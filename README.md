# voicetags

This is a prototype of an Android app to help visually impaired people using NFC tags and text-to-speech.

I built this app in 2015. I've just met a blind developer in May 2022 and had a short talk with her. Maybe someone can make use of this app.

# idea

Visually impaired people can hardly get all the information, which is given e.g. on food packaging (nutrition information etc.).
There are apps, which allow to scan the bar code on the packaging to get further information about the product.
But as you can imagine, scanning a bar code with an app is hard for visually impaired people.

The voicetags app has another approach.
When the packaging would contain a NFC tag with e.g. the GTIN, the app could easily look up further information and turn it into speech by holding the NFC capable device with the app near the packaging.

I've tested this with NFC stickers, which I applied to some packaging myself.

# problems

To make use of this app, it is required to have NFC tags on a broad range of packaging. This is not given at the moment.
